- Do not create the PR out of master, but out of a separate branch.

- The PR title should summarize the changes, for example "Add new group argument for the
  pair plot".  Avoid non-descriptive titles such as "Addresses issue #348". If your pull 
  request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to describe 
  the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request description.

  link to any relevant issues. If modifying a plot, render your plot to inspect for changes 
  and copy image in the pull request message on Github

- Please prefix the title of incomplete contributions with [WIP] (to indicate a work in 
  progress). WIPs may be useful to (1) indicate you are working on something to avoid 
  duplicated work, (2) request broad review of functionality or API, or (3) seek collaborators.
  
- If you are contributing fixes to docstrings, please pay attention to
  https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#docstring-formatting.
  In particular, note the difference between using single backquotes, double backquotes, and
  asterisks in the markup.

We understand that PRs can sometimes be overwhelming, especially as the
reviews start coming in.  Please let us know if the reviews are unclear or
the recommended next step seems overly demanding, if you would like help in
addressing a reviewer's comments, or if you have been waiting too long to hear
back on your PR.
