<!--
Before opening a PR to this repository, keep in mind the `arviz` python library only installs
arviz-base, arviz-stats and arviz-plots and exposes their functions as a common namespace.

Make sure you want to submit your PR here and to to one of these other repositories.
Some examples of PRs that should be submitted here are:

* Global documentation updates
* Issues with the `arviz` namespace not exposing elements correctly
* Infrastructure
