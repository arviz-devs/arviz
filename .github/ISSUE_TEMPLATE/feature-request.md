## Tell us about it

The more specific the better. You can assume you have access to any combination of datasets defined in the schema. When considering an implementation, keep in mind that

- models in ArviZ can have one, or lots, of random variables,
- each random variable can have very few or millions of draws,
- each random variable can have 0 or many dimensions.

## Thoughts on implementation

Not required, but if you have thoughts on how to implement the feature, that can be helpful! In case there are academic references, we welcome those here too.
