        "description": "Radon is a radioactive gas that enters homes through contact points with the ground. It is a carcinogen that is the primary cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. Radon levels vary greatly from household to household.\n\nThis example uses an EPA study of radon levels in houses in Minnesota to construct a model with a hierarchy over households within a county. The model includes estimates (gamma) for contextual effects of the uranium per household.\n\nSee Gelman and Hill (2006) for details on the example, or https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/multilevel_modeling.html by Chris Fonnesbeck for details on this implementation."

Fifteen games are played each year, representing all combinations of the six teams.\n\nThis example uses and includes results from 2014 - 2017, comprising 60 total games. It models latent parameters for each team's attack and defense, as well as a parameter for home team advantage.\n\nSee https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/rugby_analytics.html by Peader Coyle for more details and references."

        "description": "Torsion angles phi and psi are critical for determining the three dimensional structure of bio-molecules. Combinations of phi and psi torsion angles that produce clashes between atoms in the bio-molecule result in high energy, unlikely structures.\n\nThis model uses a Von Mises distribution to propose torsion angles for the structure of a glycan molecule (pdb id: 2LIQ), and a Potential to estimate the proposed structure's energy. Said Potential is bound by Boltzman's law."
