:::{tip}
Start preparing to be a PR reviewer by looking at how core contributors approach reviews.
It will serve as a way to see which ways of interacting with contributors work best
while also familiarizing with the developer guide, coding/documentation conventions and styles.

The following pull requests are good examples of constructive interaction between reviewers and contributors:

* [#2413](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/2413)
* [#2438](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/2438)
* [#2441](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/2441)
* [#2492](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/2492)
* [#2481](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/pull/2481)

The best place to start is the {ref}`pr_checklist`. Make sure all the
recommendations outlined there are followed.
