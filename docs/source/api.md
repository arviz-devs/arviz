# API

ArviZ is structured in 3 separated libraries, but we expect most users to use them all
together. All the functions and classes that are available at the top level
of these 3 libraries is also available as `arviz.<object name>`.

The complete API is described at the following pages:

* {doc}`arviz-base API <arviz_base:api/index>`
* {doc}`arviz-stats API <arviz_stats:api/index>`
* {doc}`arviz-plots API <arviz_plots:api/index>`
