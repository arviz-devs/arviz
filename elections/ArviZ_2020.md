# Election 2020

## Summary of Process
This is the first election cycle for ArviZ. During this cycle we are aiming
for the following outcomes

* Ratification of GOVERNANCE.md
* Identification and listing of Core Contributors
* Nominations for Council Candidates
* Council Elections. Particularly
  * Size of Council
  * Inaugural ArviZ Council

This being the first election means that the process will have more steps than
the ones listed in GOVERNANCE.md.

The moderators for these tasks live in the PST and CST timezone so the dates are reflective of their localities.

## Process Details
### Identification of Core Contributors (June 7th)
1. A Google Form will be shared over Slack to get core contributor names, emails, and optionally Github username.
    * Emails are needed for Elections steps so NumFOCUS can mail and track votes
    * The Google Form is moderated by Ravin (@canyon289)
2. Ravin will open a Pull Request with all names and update the PR periodically until June 12th 8pm PST, which is also the cutoff time for the form.
    * On June 12th 8pm PST Ravin will make the form's responses public as well, with exception of email
3. The pull request will stay open 24 hours at a minimum. If there is no dissent the pull request will be merged. If there is discussion the timeline below will be shifted.

Note: This is a one time process for identifying core contributors. After this cycle the core contributor acceptance process will performed by the ArviZ Council once elected

### Nominations for Council (June 14th)
1. A github issue labeled *Arviz 2020 Council Elections* will be opened for nominations
2. Core contributors can nominate themselves or other core contributors.
3. Core Contributor must accept acknowledgement with thumbs up on nomination
   * Without an acknowledgement, they will not be a candidate in the election.
   * A nomination can be explicitly declined as well in a comment, if that individual
   feels they will not be able to serve as a Council Member for any reason.
4. Nominations end at June 20th anywhere on Earth. On June 21st nominations will be compiled in the last comment and the issue will be closed.
