# Community
ArviZ is a community-driven open source project committed to host an open,
inclusive and positive community. Read the
[ArviZ Code of Conduct](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
for guidance on how to interact with each other and make the community thrive.

## Participate online
There are many alternatives and channels available to interact with other ArviZ users.

To begin with, you may want to follow us on Twitter! We are [@arviz_devs](https://twitter.com/arviz_devs).
It is the best way to be up to date with the latest developments and events related
to ArviZ.

### Gitter
The chat at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/arviz-devs/community) is a great space
to ask quick questions about ArviZ and to chat with other users and contributors.
For longer questions, the Discourse forums listed below are probably a better platform.

### Affine forums
Many ArviZ contributors are also active in one of [PyMC3 Discourse](https://discourse.pymc.io/)
or [Stan Discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/) (and sometimes even in both!).

## Conferences
* StanCon
* PyMCon

# Community educational resources
ArviZ is a transversal and backend agnostic project. One can use ArviZ with _any_ PPL,
but one has to be used in order to have some data for ArviZ to analyze.
This makes writing detailed and complete documentation for ArviZ complicated.
This section aims to act as a compilation of community resources related to ArviZ
that hopefully can bridge the gap.

Do you know of resources about ArviZ that are not listed here? Open an issue or a PR and

Blog title

Somewhat descriptive but not too long, maybe 1-2 tweets worth of text to explain
what the blog is about and why should ArviZ users care

Blog author + half sentence about them

I plan to use the blog to write about topics that I care about and are interesting to me
such as statistics, diversity or open source. The specific topic that is probably the
most interesting to people reading this is that I also use the blog as an experimental
ground for new pages in ArviZ docs.
