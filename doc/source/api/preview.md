:::{py:module} arviz.preview
This module gives access to upcoming refactored features by exposing
all objects in [arviz-base](https://arviz-base.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[arviz-stats](https://arviz-stats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[arviz-plots](https://arviz-plots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
under a single namespace: `arviz.preview`.

In addition, there is also an `arviz.preview.info` to check availability
of the different sub-libraries.
