# Translate ArviZ website and documentation
You can contribute to ArviZ by helping with translations of our website and
documentation.

:::{important}
Collaboration on translations happens on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/arviz/public/).
That means that to contribute to ArviZ translations:

* NO coding experience is required
* NO GitHub account is needed
:::

To help with translations you will need to go to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/arviz/public/)
and sign up. After that you will be able to translate strings.

We will regularly review the suggested translations and update the website.
Thus, you should not expect the website to be updated automatically
after you provide a translation on Transifex.

## Currently active translations
* Project website [www.arviz.org](https://www.arviz.org/en/latest/)
  - [Catalan translation](https://www.arviz.org/ca/latest/)
  - [Spanish translation](https://www.arviz.org/es/latest/)
  - _more translations coming?_
* Python documentation: _coming soon_
