# Translate ArviZ website and documentation
You can contribute to ArviZ by helping with translations of our website and
documentation.

:::{important}
Helping out with translations doesn't need a GitHub account,
everything happens on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/arviz/)
:::

To help with translations you will need to go to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/arviz/)
and sign up. After that you will be able to translate strings.

We will regularly review the suggested translations and update the website.
Thus, you should not expect the website to be updated automatically
after you provide a translation on Transifex.

## Currently active translations
* Project website [www.arviz.org](https://www.arviz.org/en/latest/)
  - [Catalan translation](https://www.arviz.org/ca/latest/)
  - [Spanish translation](https://www.arviz.org/es/latest/)
* Python documentation: _coming soon_
