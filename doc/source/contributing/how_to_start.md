# How to start

For adding new docs or guides, we follow the [diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework. Let's suppose you want to write a new guide and not sure where to place it in ArviZ docs, you can check the diataxis' four modes of documentation and place it accordingly.

The audience of ArviZ docs are its users and contributors. Contributing section is for contributors, sand user guide is for users. While adding the new doc files, follow the given points:

* Maintain the hierarchy of headings. There should be only one level one heading in one file, that will be the title of the page.
* Add proper explanation of the thing you want to explain, it should not be too long ot too short. Try to add the links of the external resources where the basic things are already exlained instead of adding all the explanation yourself.
* It is really important to add references. Add cross references to the ArviZ functions and objects, and external libraries.
* If you are refering to any research paper, or some website, make sure to add its hyperlink.
* Try to add the examples in the explanation. If it is a code example, add a one liner or explain a little bit before it.
