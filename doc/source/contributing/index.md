# Contributing to ArviZ
As a scientific, community-driven, open source software project,
ArviZ welcomes contributions from interested individuals or groups.
These guidelines are provided to give potential contributors information
to make their contribution compliant with the conventions of the ArviZ project,
and maximize the probability of such contributions to be merged as quickly
and efficiently as possible.

Even though contributing code or documentation by sending pull requests on
the main ArviZ GitHub repository is the most common way of contributing and
therefore also what this guide dedicates more resources, ArviZ welcomes
any kind of contributions.
As a clear proof, you can become a core contributor and participate in
[ArviZ governance](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
without having contributed code to ArviZ.
All contributions to ArviZ, either on its codebase, its documentation
or its community are valuable.

Contact us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/arviz-devs/community) if you want to
contribute to the project but you are not sure where you can contribute.

There are 4 main ways of contributing to the ArviZ _codebase_
(in descending order of difficulty or scope):

* Adding new or improved functionality to the existing codebase
* Fixing outstanding issues (bugs) with the existing codebase. They range from low-level software bugs to higher-level design problems.
* Contributing or improving the documentation (`docs`) or examples (`arviz/examples`)
* Submitting issues related to bugs or desired enhancements. Details at {doc}`issue_reports`
