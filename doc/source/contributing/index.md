# Contributing to ArviZ
As a scientific, community-driven, open source software project,
ArviZ welcomes contributions from interested individuals or groups.
These guidelines are provided to give potential contributors information
to make their contributions compliant with the conventions of the ArviZ project,
and maximize the probability of such contributions to be merged as quickly
and efficiently as possible.

Even though contributing code or documentation by sending pull requests on
the main [ArviZ GitHub repository](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz) is the most common way of contributing and
therefore this guide dedicates many resources to these, ArviZ welcomes any kind of contribution.
As a clear proof, you can become a core contributor and participate in
[ArviZ governance](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
without having contributed code to ArviZ.
All contributions to ArviZ, either on its codebase, its documentation,
or its community are valuable and we really appreciate your help.

:::{tip}
Contact us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/arviz-devs/community) if you want to
contribute to the project but you are not sure where you can contribute or how to start.
