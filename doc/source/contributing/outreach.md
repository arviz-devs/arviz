You can also contribute to ArviZ by doing outreach, writing blogposts, getting
people to use it at your company or university, helping external libraries integrate with ArviZ (in
any programming language of your choice).

If you have a website or blog where you often post about ArviZ, a library that integrates with ArviZ reach out to us or
open a PR to add your blog to {ref}`community`, we'd love to hear from you!
