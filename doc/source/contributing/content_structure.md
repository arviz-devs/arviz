# Content hierarchy and goals

For adding new docs or guides, we follow the [diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework.

The audience of ArviZ docs are its users, contributors and anyone who is intrested in the ArviZ project.
The audience of getting started, example guide, user guide and API reference are ArviZ users. On the other hand, homepage, community and about us are for the people interested in the ArviZ project, i.e., users, contributors and other people too.
Contributing section is for ArviZ contributors, if anyone wants to contribute to ArviZ but is not sure where to start, contirbuting section will help.

While adding the new doc files, follow the given points:

* Maintain the hierarchy of headings. There should be only one level one heading in one file, that will be the title of the page.
* Add proper explanation of the thing you want to explain, it should not be too long ot too short. Try to add the links of the external resources where the basic things are already exlained instead of adding all the explanation yourself.
* Top level pages should have the table of content tree, and all the bottom pages should be mentioned in it, see {ref}`syntax_guide`.
* It is really important to add references. Add cross references to the ArviZ functions and objects, and external libraries.
* If you are refering to any research paper, or some website, make sure to add its hyperlink.
* Try to add the examples in the explanation. If it is a code example, add one liner or explain it a little bit before every example. Try to cover all the possible scenarios or if they are a lot, just cover the important ones.
* Highlight the keywords using backticks.
