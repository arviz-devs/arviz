# ArviZ Community Code of Conduct

ArviZ is an affiliated project of NumFocus and adopts the NumFocus Code of Conduct directly.
In other words ArviZ is a part of the NumFocus community and we expect our community to
treat others with kindness and understanding, just as they would in any other NumFOCUS project.


# THE SHORT VERSION  
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
